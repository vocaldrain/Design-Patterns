## What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problem in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to sovle a particular design problem in your code.

## When/Why Design Pattern?

* Reusability: Design patterns encapsulate best practices, making it easier to reuse proven solutions to common problems.
*  Maintainability: By Following established patterns, code becomes more predictable and easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
*  Communication: Developers familiar with design patterns can communicate more effectively using common terminology and concepts.
*  Scalability: Patterns help in creating scalable architecture by provding guidelines for organizing code in a modular and extensible manner.

## Types/Classification of Design Patterns?

Design Patterns can be classified into several categories based on their purpose and scope. The most common classification include:

1. Creational Pattern:
These pattern focus on the creation of objects, providing flexibility in how objects are instantiated.
Example: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

2. Structural Pattern:
Structural Pattern deal with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures.
Example: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

3. Behavioral Pattern:
Behavioral Pattern are concerned with communication between objects and the delegation of reposibilities
Example : Observer, Strategy, Command, Template Method, Iterator, Visitor, Memento, State, Mediator, Chain of Responsibility pattern.

4. Concurrency Pattern:
These pattern address concerns related to concurrent programming ensuring safe and efficient execution in multi-threaded environment.It includes Dealing with Sharing, Dealing with Mutation, Concurrent Architecture
Example: Thread Pool, Producer-Consumer, Read-Write Lock, Semaphore, and Monitor Object Pattern.

5. Architectural Pattern:
Architectural pattern provide high-level guidelines for organizing the structure of entire applications or systems.
Example: Model-View_controller, Model-View-ViewModel, Layered Architecture, Microservices, and Event-Drivern Architecture pattern

6. Other Pattern
There are additional pattern that do not fit neatly into above categories.
Example: Anti-Pattern, Idioms
